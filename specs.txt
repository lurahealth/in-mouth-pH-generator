Output:

    6 months of pH data formatted exactly
    as data would be received from sensor

          a.aa,bb.b,cccc,dddd

    a = calibrated pH ; 2.0 <= cal pH <= 10.0
        calibrated pH must have 3 sig figs

    b = temperature in degrees celsius
        temperature must have 3 sig figs

    c = batttery level in millivolts

    d = isfet raw output in millivolts

    * Data should be prefixed with a
      timestamp (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss) UTC

    Total rows; 262,800 min / 5 min = 52,560 rows

Logic:

    pH level randomization:

    - set of pH values with distribution more
      heavily weighted around neutral value
    - While formatting rows, randomly select
      pH value from this set

    - Set period of time (night, lunch, etc)
      where pH selection will be be more
      heavily weighted to non-nuetral pH
    - Whenever row formatter chooses a time
      within set period for varied weighting,
      randomly pick pH from that set  instead
