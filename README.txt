This program can be used to generate 6 months worth of simulated in-mouth pH data, analogous to what the Lura Health device will capture. 

Users can configure periods of time where randomized pH values are weighted to be "unhealthy", such that predictable pH trends can be identified.

These datasets are useful for testing databases, analytics, and various other applications.
